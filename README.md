Purpose of the Project

This project simulates adaptive beamforming, a critical technology in wireless communication systems, particularly for adaptive antenna arrays and MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) systems. The simulation demonstrates key concepts such as beam steering, sidelobe control, and performance metrics, helping users visualize how antenna arrays adapt their beam patterns to optimize signal reception and minimize interference.

Key Features

1. Beam Steering Control

Allows users to adjust the steering angle to direct the antenna beam in real-time.

Visual representation of beam direction based on the user's input.



2. Adaptive Sidelobe Control

Users can control the sidelobe levels using a slider, affecting interference suppression and signal clarity.

Immediate visual feedback on the beam pattern changes.



3. Dynamic Visualization

Real-time updates to the beam pattern are drawn on a canvas element.

Visualizes how changes in the number of elements and steering angles affect the overall beamforming performance.



4. Performance Metrics

Displays important metrics like:

Beamwidth: Indicates the spread of the main beam.

Signal Strength: Reflects the effectiveness of the beamforming.

Sidelobe Level: Shows interference suppression capability.

How the Simulation Works

1. User Inputs:

Number of Elements: Specifies how many antenna elements are in the array.

Steering Angle: Controls the direction in which the beam is focused.

Sidelobe Level: Adjusts the suppression of sidelobes to minimize interference.



2. JavaScript Logic:

Calculates the phase shifts for each antenna element based on the steering angle.

Uses trigonometric functions to simulate and render the beam pattern.

Updates the canvas to reflect beamforming changes in real-time.

3. Visualization:

The beam pattern is drawn on an HTML canvas element, showing the main beam and sidelobes.

Metrics are displayed to provide quantitative feedback on beamforming performance.
